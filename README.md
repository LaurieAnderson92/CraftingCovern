# CovenCrafts

CovenCrafts is your enchanting haven for handmade crochet creations with a spooky twist! From adorable plushie Familiars to intricately crafted gothic decor, each piece is lovingly designed to bring a touch of magic and mystery to your life. Perfect for Halloween enthusiasts, witchy vibes, or anyone who adores the eerie and unique. Step into the world of CovenCrafts and discover handcrafted treasures that are both hauntingly beautiful and irresistibly cosy.

I built this website to facilitate bespoke crafting creations made by the extremely talented people in my social circle. The idea is that they can upload their own creations and receive payment via bespoke comissions. everything is made to order with an option to as for alterations that the crafter can make. My goal is to put the power directly in the crafter's hands as much as the customers. So that a crafter can create a listing out and about on a mobile or tablet while at a market stall, hand the device over to the customer and make the sale there and then, as well as have a website that customers can be referred to.

All of the crafters are hobbyists who make things for the love of crafting. None of them express a desire to make this a full time and main source of income and instead want a tool to augment their current volume.

## Business Plan

To provide a simple, affordable, and efficient platform for crafters to showcase their handmade creations, manage commissions, and connect with customers, all while maintaining flexibility for their side business.

CovenCraft is an app designed for my friends who are hobbyists. They wish to sell their handmade goods and take commissions without the complexities of managing a full-fledged business. The app emphasizes ease of use, low costs, and minimal time investment, catering to their on the fly needs for this side hustle. It's meant to be a low-cost, easy structure with no mandatory subscription fees—commission-based pricing to align with the users' side business model. It also links to a discord group that has been used to take commissions, so future integration with that would be idea.

Revenue wise, this is a passion product of mine to make their lives easier so no Commission on Sales is Taken. The delivery cost is caulated on the fly using their qyuick mental pricing of £10 or 10% of the cost, whichever is greater as the cost of the commission directly corolates to the size of the commission.

By having a web page, it becomes one step closer to becoming a ltd company, A portion of any Savings made from VAT will flow into the upkeep of this app and treats for their eager pet fullstack developer

A mock FB page was made and linked in the deployed version. Facebook may delete fake store pages so I have left a screenshot below:

## Development

Agile priciples were followed for this app, however I tried to splut off brances and merge development brances with squashed commit messages, normally I would delete these, but the development branches have been left for you to review.

Sometimes, when I tried to do this, I ended up with some messy merges using Gitpod integrated features. These have been cleaned as best I could.

This has been a great experience in learning and working with UX, I've discovered its an area of weakness for me and one I seek to improve on.

## Design
### Colour Scheme

![Colour Palette of Whitesmoke, Alabaster, Amber, Onyx and Eerie Black](assets/documentation/colourpalette.jpeg)

#### F5F5F5 | Whitesmoke 
* I used Whitesmoke as a offwhite colour as the background for the page, as #FFFFFF has a very sterile and clinical feel to it, and this muted white has a matt loock that contrasts with Amber and Onyx

#### EFECE5 | Alabaster
* Alabaster was picked for me, as it is the background of the striking image I put on my front page and login pages, using it throught the site creates consistancy

#### FFc107 | Amber
* Amber is a a ligter shake of Pumpkin, which was origionally used. I picked amber because of its lighter contrast and higher yellow value which makes it easier to see for users who are corona-diverse

#### 353935 | Onyx
* Onyx was also picked for me as It's the colour of the witch's outfit in my main image and it constrasts nice with the alabaster.

#### 800080 | Eerie Black
* Eerie black is a off black, and was chosen for the same reason as Whitesmoke, to mimic ink or the black of a witch's hat than the dark black associated with computer text.

### Typography

I chose to use the Lovers Quarrel font from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to look like writing within a spellbook. it has a flowy and distinctive style that's memorable.

I used Geist for a simple, clean look that's sans serif so it'll be eaiser to read on a smaller screen

#### Checkout Page
![Screenshot of a Checkout page](assets/documentation/features_checkout.jpg)  

### Future Implementations

In The Future, I would like to implement as part of the next release:

#### A Time Tracking method for crafters
Have server side logic so that a Crafter can set the amount of time they have spare in the week, and have puchases track go against that time, to prevent a flurry of orders coming in above their supply. This has already been partially created, with each product listing how many hours it would take. and a crafters profile having how many hours they can do in a week plus how many hours they have spare.

#### Automated emails
Emails that are sent out automatically when an order is placed, along with intergrating a newsletter 

#### Webhooks with Stripe
Webhooks to react when an order is placed.

Furthjer down the Pipeline is would be:

* A comment and review funtionality for each product
* Site Traffic reporting
* A way to apply bulk discounts.
* A way to attribute each product to a crafter


### Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible as possible. This has been achieved by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state on all buttons on the site to make it clear to the user if they are hovering over a button.
* All Icons have aria labels so that they can be used by screen readers
* The colour pallate works for users with achromatic vision as can be demonstrated [here](https://coolors.co/f5f5f5-efede5-ffc107-353935-800080)
